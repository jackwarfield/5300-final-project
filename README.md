# 5300 Final Project

This project consists of two notebooks: Double_Pendulum.ipynb and Gravitational_System.ipynb.

Double_Pendulum uses a class to solve the differential equations for a double-pendulum, plots the angles vs. time, and then animates the motion of the pendulums. Specifically, it shows that when you move past the domain of the small angle approximation, the system becomes chaotic and very dependent on initial conditions.

Gravitational_System uses a class to solve the differential equations for a 2-body gravitationally-bound system and then animates the movements of the bodies. In this notebook, we see that, from the center of mass frame, the objects follow elliptical orbits around the center of mass, which is equivalent to the result that is found earlier in the semester.

plotting_functions.py contains functions used for making the $\theta(t)$ plots in Double_Pendulum.ipynb
